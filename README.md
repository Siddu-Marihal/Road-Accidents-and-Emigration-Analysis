# Overview 
This repository contains datasets and analyses related to two important issues in India: road accidents and migrant worker emigration. The data has been compiled from official government reports and structured into standardized datasets to facilitate further research and insights. Additionally, Excel files containing metadata—including information about the datasets and the links to data sources used for collection—are provided for transparency and reference.

## Task 1: Road Accidents in India
### Road accidents cause a significant loss of lives in India every year. Using data from the latest Road Accidents in India report, this dataset provides:

- Year-wise and State-wise total number of road accidents in India since 2011.
- Year-wise and State-wise number of road accidents per thousand vehicles in India since 2011.
- Validation with NCRB’s ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’ report to ensure consistency.
- Trend analysis to determine whether road accidents have increased or declined over time.

## Task 2: Emigration of Indian Migrant Workers
### Migrant worker emigration is a crucial socio-economic phenomenon in India. This dataset is compiled from secondary research and government sources to answer:

- Total number of Indians who received Emigration Clearances in the last decade.
- Number of employers registered on the e-Migrate portal and the major sectors they belong to.
- Major destination countries for Indian migrant workers.
- Complaints received and prosecution sanctions against illegal recruitment agents, given the risks of fake agents and human trafficking.

## Additional Resources
Files containing metadata provide details about the datasets, including data descriptions and links to official sources.
Visualizations and trend analyses are included for better interpretation of the data.
This repository aims to provide a structured foundation for policymakers, researchers, and analysts to derive meaningful insights into these critical issues.

# The Analysis

## Task 1:

![Accidents Per 1000 Vehicles](https://github.com/Siddu-Marihal/Road-Accidents-and-Emigration-Analysis/blob/c852fb37ec489cc5843ea9772c06ecc8082e5a50/images/Accidents.png)

### Analysis of Accidents Per 1000 Vehicles (NCRB vs. MoRTH)
1. Overall Trend:
Both datasets show a declining trend in accidents per 1,000 vehicles from 2011 to 2020, indicating improved road safety.
2. NCRB vs. MoRTH Data:
2011: NCRB reports a higher accident rate than MoRTH.
2013–2015: MoRTH data is higher than NCRB, suggesting variations in reporting methods.
2016–2020: Both datasets align closely, showing a consistent downward trend.
3. Key Observations:
2011–2013: Sharp decline in accident rates.
2013–2015: Fluctuations, with MoRTH reporting higher values.
2016–2020: Steady decline, reaching around 1 accident per 1,000 vehicles in 2020.
4. Possible Reasons for Variations:
Different data sources: NCRB relies on police reports, while MoRTH may use transport department data.
Improved reporting accuracy in later years.
5. COVID-19 Effect in 2020:
The sharp decline in 2020 can be attributed to reduced vehicular movement during lockdowns, leading to fewer accidents.
Conclusion:
Despite minor variations, both datasets confirm a significant reduction in road accidents per 1,000 vehicles over time, with COVID-19 further accelerating the decline in 2020.
